# Heart Disease Prediction

## Data Description
age: age of the patients

sex: sex of the patients either male or female (0 for female, 1 for male)

cp: chest pain experienced by the patients (0 typical angina, 1 atypical angina, 2 non- anginal pain, 3 asymptomatic (Nominal))

trestbps: patient's level of blood pressure at resting mode in mm/HG (Numerical)

chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl (Numeric)

fbs: Blood sugar levels on fasting > 120 mg/dl (1 in case of true and 0 as false (Nominal))

restecg: Result of electrocardiogram while at rest
(0 : Normal 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV))

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved (Numeric)

exang: Angina induced by exercise 0 depicting NO 1 depicting Yes (Nominal)

oldpeak: Exercise induced ST-depression in relative with the state of rest (Numeric)

slope: ST segment measured in terms of slope during peak exercise
(0: up sloping; 1: flat; 2: down sloping(Nominal)

ca: The number of major vessels (0â€“3)(nominal))

thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia
(0: NULL 1: normal blood flow 2: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart) 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal(nominal))

target: It is the target variable which we have to predict (1 means patient is suffering from heart disease and 0 means patient is normal)
